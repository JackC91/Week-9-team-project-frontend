/*
Plan
  This component will render 5 stars as images / icons
  The functionality to set an amount of stars will be coded once main App functionality works
    - The stars when coded will go from unfilled to filled onClick and backend functionality will follow
*/

/*
Code
- hard code 5 star images for demonstrative purposes: hard code once direction decided 

- User logs into account
- see 5 stars greyed out and prompt to "rate proficiency"
- user clicks star to set proficiency level 
- proficiency saved between sessions can be set by clicking any star - filling in stars before it
