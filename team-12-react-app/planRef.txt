*/

/*
Code
- hard code 5 star images for demonstrative purposes: hard code once direction decided 

- User logs into account
- see 5 stars greyed out and prompt to "rate proficiency"
- user clicks star to set proficiency level 
- proficiency saved between sessions can be set by clicking any star - filling in stars before it

- backend will have star value starting at 0
when user loads the page GET request to dislay stars based on current star value
  (starting at zero or based on the number they left it at prior)
- when user clicks a star a post request will be sent to back-end with star value
- immediately sends a GET request to display number of stars based on value given
