/*
Plan
  This component will render 5 stars as images / icons
  The functionality to set an amount of stars will be coded once main App functionality works
    - The stars when coded will go from unfilled to filled onClick and backend functionality will follow
*/

/*
Code
- hard code 5 star images for demonstrative purposes: hard code once direction decided 

   ??? - 2 images representing a state filled / unfilled for each star
    - unfilled is default state = false
    - images are buttons
      - onClick if false make true
        - if true make false 
        - if true then filled 
        - if false then unfilled
