## School of Code Proficiency Tracker




The brief we were given revolved around improving the learning experience of fellow School of Code bootcampers.

The problem we identified was that of keeping track of the vast amount of learning required by a new developer.

## Project Status


This project is currently in development. 
Users can add tasks to the main display of the app which then updates the database. 
Part of our continued development would be to add a landing page, linking the star rating with the database and further refinements.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Backend Installation:

Go to: 

`../w9_backend-project-team_12`

To Install Dependecies:  

`npm install`  

To Run Test Suite:  

`npm test`  

To Create Table:

`npm run db:createTable`

To Start Server:

`npm start`  

 Now the backend is up and running and ready to be interacted with. Time to install the Frontend.

 Frontend Installation:

 Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

## Reflection

  
  This was a week long project between School of Code bootcampers with varying degrees of coding experience. We were given a brief on Monday, with a presentation for Senior Developers delivered on Friday.
  
  We set out to build a fullstack application solving the problems outlined above. Our high level goals were to build a REST API that interacted with our React Frontend via CRUD operations. We built this using the Ahile methodology and incorporating the full UX/UI process.
 
  One of the main challenges we faced was settling on the final features of our MVP and the core functionality addressing the statement problem. The deadline provided was particularly difficult to meet.
  
  These are the tools that we used:
  React, React Create Stars Library, React Testing Library VSCode, Express, Cors, PostgreSQL, Nodejs, Heroku DB, Jest, Postman, Trello, Figma, GoogleDocs, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

  We chose to use tools that we had been shown on the bootcamp to further our understanding of them and cut down on the time needed to learn new tools.
